## Setup

### 1. üìù Project Properties

1. Search and replace `projectname` and `PROJECT_NAME` throughout the project.
2. From source directories, rename `dev/yekta/projectname` to the package name.
3. Configure XML files within `res` directory (including icon & colors).

### 2. üîß Release Config

Append the following lines into the root `local.properties` (create if doesn't exist):

```properties
RELEASE_KEYSTORE_FILE=keystore_path
RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PWD=keystore_pass
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=key_alias
RELEASE_KEY_PWD=key_pass
```

### 3. üé® Theming

Head over to the
[Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) and export
the desired theme for the app.

### 4. üöÄ Happy Crafting!

_Note: If you don't plan to use Decompose and just want a minimal boilerplate, you may use the repo
before the `34689c45` commit._
